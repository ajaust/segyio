Introduction
------------

Segyio is a small LGPL licensed C library for easy interaction with SEG Y
formatted seismic data, with language bindings for Python and Matlab. Segyio is
an attempt to create an easy-to-use, embeddable, community-oriented library for
seismic applications. Features are added as they are needed; suggestions and
contributions of all kinds are very welcome.

Feature summary
---------------
 * A low-level C interface with few assumptions; easy to bind to other
   languages.
 * Read and write binary and textual headers.
 * Read and write traces, trace headers.
 * Easy to use and native-feeling python interface with numpy integration.

Project goals
-------------

Segyio does necessarily attempt to be the end-all of SEG-Y interactions;
rather, we aim to lower the barrier to interacting with SEG-Y files for
embedding, new applications or free-standing programs.

Additionally, the aim is not to support the full standard or all exotic (but
correctly) formatted files out there. Some assumptions are made, such as:

 * All traces in a file are assumed to be of the same sample size.
 * It is assumed all lines have the same number of traces.

The writing functionality in Segyio is largely meant to *modify* or adapt
files. A file created from scratch is not necessarily a to-spec SEG-Y file, as
we only necessarily write the header fields segyio needs to make sense of the
geometry. It is still highly recommended that SEG-Y files are maintained and
written according to specification, but segyio does not mandate this.
